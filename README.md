# Episode 1/2: The Neural Network Data Structure 

</div>

In episode 1, we explore how to create a Neural Network to solve
the "Exclusive Or" problem:

| Input 1 | Input 2 | Output |
|---------|---------|--------|
| 0       | 0       | 0      |
| 0       | 1       | 1      |
| 1       | 0       | 1      |
| 1       | 1       | 0      |

The Neural Network we create will have 2 input nodes, 1 hidden node, 
and 1 output node. To keep life simple, we will use the ReLU
activation function (Simply `max(0, sum)`). 

# Training
No training will happen in this neural network, as we are just worried
about the structure of a neural network. We will plug in exact values
for the weights and biases to make the neural network work.
